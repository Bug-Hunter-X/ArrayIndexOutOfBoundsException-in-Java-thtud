# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `Bug.java` file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range.  The `BugSolution.java` file shows how to correct this error by using proper bounds checking. 

This error occurs when you try to access an array element using an index that is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the array's length.   It's crucial to always validate array indices before accessing them to prevent unexpected crashes.
